This repository contains my personal configuration files, also known as "dotfiles", for several tools that I use in my development environment. These include:

- **yabai:** A tiling window manager for macOS that allows you to manage your windows using keyboard shortcuts.

- **skhd:** A hotkey daemon for macOS that works in conjunction with yabai and allows you to define custom keyboard shortcuts.

- **tmux:** A terminal multiplexer that lets you organize multiple terminal sessions in a single window.

- **zshrc:** A configuration file for the Zsh shell, which is a popular alternative to the default Bash shell on macOS.

- **ideavimrc:** A configuration file for the IdeaVim plugin, which brings Vim keybindings to the IntelliJ IDEA and other JetBrains IDEs.

- **nvim:** A configuration file for Neovim, a modern fork of the Vim text editor.

- **alacritty:** A modern, GPU-accelerated terminal emulator for macOS.

These dotfiles are tailored to my personal preferences and workflow, but you are welcome to use them as a starting point for your own customizations.
